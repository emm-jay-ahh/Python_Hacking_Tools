# Python_Hacking_Tools

<br />

Tools I create with Python for use with Ethical Hacking or Pen-Testing

Wanting to create my own toolkit/framework like metasploi

<br />

### Project_01: Mac Address Changer
  * Two tools currently
    * maccas_choice.py - User is required to enter the MAC address they wish to use
    * maccas_random.py - Tool will generate a random MAC address for you
  
  * Will combine into one tool in the future - for now qill conitnue to debug and updates seperately
