# Python Hacking Tools

<br />


**I keep reading around the interwebs 'to learn python as fast as possible you must build projects'**

**Sounds pretty wise, so I am going to build python apps around the things I am keen on learning. HACKING!**

**I am utilising Online Videos, Tutorials including CCC_Bootcamp to help me learn and build**

**A journey of creating my own toolkit/framework something like the Metasploit Framework - (not as good)**

**Start with the tools I want in my arsenal and use Python to build them out**

**Then add a terminal menu system to access all these tools from one easy location**


<br />


### I am using Kali Linux 2021.2 as my Development Environment for building these tools

### Most tools will require elevated privileges "sudo" to operate

### WARNING: Do not run unless you understand what the tools are doing
